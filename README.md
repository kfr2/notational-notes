# Notational Notes
* *A quick script for converting the text-based notes directory of [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/)/[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) (or other text editors) to a folder of HTML files.*
* Converts each note based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.

## Setup & Usage
1. Determine whether or not you would like to `hide_private` files and update the setting appropriately.
2. Run `notational-notes.rb input_directory output_directory`
3. Copy `css` into `output_directory`.
3. `output_directory` should now contain HTML-based copies of your NV/similar notes.
